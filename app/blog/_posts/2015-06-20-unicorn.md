Designers in this sense have moved on from crafting brand experiences, through branding, color theory and a number of other aspects that was once imparted on design for front-end CSS & Javascript development. Startups and bootstrapped agencies have coerced designers, developers and inviduals to adapt and learn a varying skillsets.


The problem with the unicorn is individuals are moving towards money and not necessarily towards building better. A higher likelyhood of successful products depends on people who understand the landscape and environment of the organization they operate in and not necessarily the industry trend. Someone who ultimately moves on from the world of photoshop comps into designing and developing front-end design for a product.

As much as I hate the word - I'd argue, a true unicorn, is a designer that embraces business goals and approachs their design to achieve measurable results - conversion goals, user sign ups, reduction abandonment or whatever other metric that is valuable to the success and growth of the underlying product. Typically considered a marketing roles,  its important designers identify KPI's and work towards leading a successful product through design and not design & development.

Unicorn 2.0 is essentially an individual that produces thoughtful work spanning user-goals, business goals and sustains business growth. They're aware, but not necessarily masters of, KPI's and other metrics that are key to success and growth of their overall product. They make informed decisions and architect experiences that are successful with and without the requirement of aesethically pleasing, andprecise front-end development.

What happens after the user is happy with your product but isn't engaged? We need a level of designs that look beyond coding as a means to end and see measurable metrics as a method of growing a business altogether. 

Leave the execution of high-quality design to the number of developers who are interested in design. As designers adopt new skillsets they too shift their focus from producing code to actually finesing and crafting it.

As a designer who can code - HTML/CSS, rudimentary Javascript, all of which are self-taught out of necessity more than providing true value to a development team, are indepensible to a team. They're by no means skillsets and traits I feel every designer should have, rather, ones that designers have picked up due to the ease and tight hand-hold design and coding share in an environment where software development is seen as a means to an end. I make things and those things inherently have value, when made is often not the case. It requires a boat full of skilled individuals to get the product successful.

Development just like good design takes years to master. UI design and front-end development are small fraction of whats required for a successful product let alone brand experience, re-brand and a number of other tradtional graphic design related areas.


Of course, we need team members to work well together. Designers who can code provide value to an overarching team by being able to ensure their thoughts in design transfer well over into development. Debugging CSS for example is a key area where designers knowing CSS provide extrinsic value to developers who's main goal isn't CSS/HTML accuracy but to ship a product.

Shared responsibilities or team, overlapping in skill-sets and an empathic approach towards users and business goals alike that leads ultimately to success.

Indispensable value to a team where design and code are interlocked tightly and the final product depends on great execution. 

There's a lot missing from this equation, namely strategies around what we're designing and why we're doing it. It's the overlap of business goals 

Cycle of product design and development where metrics such as growth, user-base and ultimately business goals are inherently more important to the design process than coding.
