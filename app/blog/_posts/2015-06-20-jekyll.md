I've been asked a few times about Jekyll, what's good about it and why I ended up using it for my portfolio and blog.

I could begin to explain the history behind Wordpress and other blog engines and make claims why they suck. The truth is, I choose Jekyll because its supported by Github Pages, the markup and fact pages uses Markdown was attractive and it seemed like a good challenge.

Jekyll, Shopify, Squarespace all run on the same liquid templating langauge so despite being a designer, I figured learning the langauge would allow me to develop or speak towards the constraints around each platform, whenever a client project arose.

Jekyll is a static, database-less file system consisting of posts, includes, layouts (templates). The whole thing sits un-rendered and a build commmand essentially converts markdown pages, includes, etc into a fully flushed out HTML/CSS/JS site.

The basic structure consists of:
