My name is Amit Patel. Currently, I am an ACD at [UnitOneNine](http://www.unitonenine.com) in Chicago. I'm a designer that specializes in user experience design, brand strategy and art direction. Though I'm not a developer by trade, I love front-end development. Check out my [github](http://www.github.com/mramitpatel).

This site was built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), [Bourbon, Neat](http://bourbon.io/) and Sass with the build tools - [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) and [Bower](http://bower.io/).

Feel free to reach out, I'm always looking to [connect](mailto:amit@mramitpatel.com).
