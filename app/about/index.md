title: "Great at many things - sports not one of them."
---
I live and work and occasionally play sports in Chicago, one of the greatest cities on earth. I work with a majority of clients that need design, strategy and overall guidance through the digital landscape. Currently, I do this as an ACD at [UnitOneNine](http://www.unitonenine.com). I'm a designer that specializes in user experience design, creative direction, brand strategy and art direction. Though I'm not a developer by trade, I love front-end development. Check out my [github](http://www.github.com/mramitpatel).

I have a BFA in Visual Communications with a focus in Graphic Design. Over the course of my career, I've helped startups, small businesses and Fortune 500 define their digital strategy, provided content strategy and creative direction for a number of initatives.

This site was built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), [Bourbon, Neat](http://bourbon.io/) and Sass with the build tools - [Gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com/) and [Bower](http://bower.io/). If you're interested in reading how its made, checkout my [blog](/blog).

Feel free to reach out, I'm always looking to [connect](mailto:amit@mramitpatel.com).
