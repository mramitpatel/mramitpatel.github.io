#### Initial Sketches & Direction
Vision is an vital aspect of life and representing surgical treatments online is a challenging task. I knew I wanted to create an expressive, vibrant experience that celebrated the concepts of vision. To do this, I used isolated imagery to create singular strong focal points. By using clipping masks and overlapping images, gives a sense of depth. I wanted to avoid parallax effects and cheesy effects and focus primarily on bold colors, photographs and type.
