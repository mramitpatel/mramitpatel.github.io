Redesigning a website for a product infamously known for informercial background is challenging. Kyrobak, an unknown back pain relief product emerged to the market prior to tech based products. During this time, marketing and sales around said products was generally done via TV spots, radio and web-ads. Though conversion was generally high, as high designed tech products emerged, so did a new method of branding, marketing and overall brand perception.

##### Initial Brief & Copy
<article>
Standard to many projects, I was handed a sparse copy document that had some content suggestions. Step one in my process was to audit the content, see what is valid and get back to the client with questions and concerns.

##### Creative Direction and Positioning

<aside>
Kyrobak was created during a team when Silicon valley startups were nil and the healthcare tech world was non-existent. The brand, itself, is devoid of aspects that would sell to users with zero pain. To evolve positioning, I looked to the emerging tech space of wearables and startups focused in solving specific ailments. Injecting a sense of technology focused on pain lead by science, built for everyone - not just the elderly in back pain.

##### Personas

<aside>
I crafted a few quick personas to illustrate user needs based off lifestyle and potential types of people currently not being addressed by Kyrobak. These users range from elderly in back pain to younger individuals focused on maintaining their own health. Like newer health realted tech devices, proactivity could be a key factor in buying a Kyrobak. Range, flexibility, motion are aspects many can relate with.
