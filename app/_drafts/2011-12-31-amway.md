description: "Razorfish was in dire need of Art Direction and production work for Amway's new web redesign. With 2 weeks, initial wire-frames and a site structure - I was able to complete designs for Nutrlite, E-Spring, Artistry and Amway.com's main landing page. The project was completed with UnitOneNine. Unfortunately, Amway decided to abandon the solution in favor of an inferior solution."

summary: "Redesigning a family of products for one of America's largest multi-level marketing giants."
