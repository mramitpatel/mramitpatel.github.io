#### Overview
Walton Isaacson is an agency located in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. With clients such as Lexus, Jim Beam and Axe they're no small wonder yet commonly are unheard of.

This quick site redesign pitch was done in a few days to showcase our abilities to quickly produce high-quality concepts in a short amount of time. Though spec-work is never a good idea, furthering relationships by offering free services is.

Little brand equity and identity meant conjuring up appeal through type, color, tone and showcasing the work.
