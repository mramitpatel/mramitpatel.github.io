overview: "Creating a brand and website for ZAMRIE was a new and challenging task. The brand and site needed to represent Ashleyâ€™s stylings and simplicity while retaining her inspiration of bold modern looks.<br><br> The website was designed to feel elegant, sophisticated and retain a high-fashion appeal. I pulled inspiration from fashion editorials and employed various design patterns and styling that was both elegant without feeling too art nouveau."
