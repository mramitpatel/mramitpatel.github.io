##### Initial Sketches & Direction
Vision is an vital aspect of life and representing surgical treatments online is a challenging task. I knew I wanted to create an expressive, vibrant experience that celebrated the concepts of vision. To do this, I used isolated imagery to create singular strong focal points. By using clipping masks and overlapping images, gives a sense of depth. I wanted to avoid parallax effects and cheesy effects and focus primarily on bold colors, photographs and type.

I evolved the brand by creating a world of design elements that could work across both online and printed materials. 

Bold colors, aspirational photos and graphic treatments makes the new site different than their competitors. I wanted to create an identifiable brand language through graphic treatments and colors.

The Brand color palette was dated and needed a revival. I created a palette that worked well with legacy values and expanded the color palette to encompass the variety of eye-procedures. Eye surgery is daunting enough, bringing life, humantity and energy into an otherwise sterile brand.
