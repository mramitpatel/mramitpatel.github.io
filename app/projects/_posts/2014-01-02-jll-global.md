overview: "JLL is one of the worlds largest commercial real-estate brokers. With the real estate industry back on the rise, JLL looked to invest heavily in their digital presence. In order to bring JLL up to speed, I redesigned the global and country pages for all regions across the globe.

#### Phase 1: Pitch
To win the work, I pitched a few layout ideas that would help elevate design and surface areas of content, I felt were important to JLL users, to the surface. Early on, I knew I wanted to create a more accessible version of JLL, less focused on design trends, and more focused on surfacing information.

#### Messaging 
I pitched JLL on homepage messaging ideas that fit into the core concept of the future of JLL. My core concept was to show the breadth of JLL and how their properties affect the lives of many. Though primarily a commercial B2B brand, I wanted to push JLL to embrace a more consumer friendly face. To help communicate and illstrate tactile headline applications - I created and presented a deck to JLL's Digital Marketing managers. Unfortunately, the idea was scrapped in favor of the current solution.

#### Phase 2: Extending the Brand 
In 2014, I revisted global pages by redesigning them towards a central branded experience. Part of JLL's legacy brand was the use of a square as a lexicon. I extended the brand by marrying Helvetica Neue and a Swiss typographic and grid design approach across all major layouts.
