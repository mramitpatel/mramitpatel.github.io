<section class="overview">
##### Transforming LaSalle.com into an worldwide investment management website.
<article>
Heads turned with the immediate progress and success of JLL's global website. As a subsidiary, LaSalle is an Real Estate Investment Managemet firm. For the redesign, I created site wireframes, flows and provided content strategy throughout the website. I Creative Directed and designed pages focusing on content strategy and making information more accessible. Overall, I wanted to give LaSalle it's own independant voice and showcase their portfolio of products. Though the brand retains its legacy components, I updated visual styles, typography and updated the overall color pallete.

###### Old Fashioneds before they were cool
The crux of any liquor site, the recipes. Since curation was key, a basic recipe layout and design was used to account for varying assets and editability in Expression Engine.
