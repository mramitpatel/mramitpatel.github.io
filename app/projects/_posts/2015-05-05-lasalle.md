##### Overview
<article>

LaSalle Investments is one of the largest Real-Estate Investment Management firms in the world. They manage over $57 Bi in assets across the globe.

For the redesign, I created site wireframes, flows and provided content strategy throughout the website. I Creative Directed and designed pages focusing on content strategy and making information more accessible. Overall, I wanted to give LaSalle it's own independant voice and showcase their portfolio of products. Though the brand retains its legacy components, I updated visual styles, typography and updated the overall color pallete.

##### Wireframes
Wireframing each section allowed for both internal and client teams to get started on content population and get a sense of how pages would be structured. I used wireframes to approximate content and speak towards specific areas of "web messaging". The wireframes served as a tool to develop content that fit ideal scale and length from a design perspective but also a messaging one.

A known challenge was how to handle varying resolution image assets and the ability to create an engaging experience post launch. Early sketches to experiment on layout, typography and tone helped define the final version.
